Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1) Some applications or petitions approved, denied, or pending a decision may have been received in previous reporting periods. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
2) The report reflects the most up-to-date estimate available at the time the database is queried.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3) Forms received, completed (approved and denied), and pending counts may differ from counts reported in previously published reports due to processing delays and the time at which the data are queried, system updates, and post-adjudicative outcomes.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"4) Completed are the number of applications or petitions approved or denied. Some benefit types include other outcomes, such as administrative closures, in the total number of completed cases. As such, approvals and denials will not sum to the total number of completions for all benefit types.",,,,,,,,,,,,
5) Forms where a processing time is unavailable are shown with an N/A. Processing times may be unavailable for a variety of reasons such as forms pending a processing times calculation or forms where times cannot be calculated. ,,,,,,,,,,,,
6) Summing the six I-485 types and the four I-765 types results in the overall totals for each form for the reporting period. ,,,,,,,,,,,,
"7) Credible Fear and Reasonable Fear screenings (and their respective forms I-870 and I-899) do not confer an immigration benefit, rather they are intended to identify individuals with viable protection claims, which are then referred to the Immigration Courts for adjudication. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
   Asylum Officers do not adjudicate the actual asylum applications during the screening process.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"8) For the I-131 (humanitarian parole), approvals are defined as conditional approval of the request for parole contingent upon successful completion of identity verification and any additional medical and security checks as required. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
"    A request for humanitarian parole may be counted as closed for a number of reasons, including if the beneficiary withdraws the request or if USCIS has notified the petitioner that the case is eligible for further parole processing and is awaiting notification from the petitioner that the parole ",,,,,,,,,,,,
    beneficiary is in a location with a U.S. embassy or consulate.,,,,,,,,,,,,
9) The majority of the I-730 completions are captured in CLAIMS3 and included in this data. The I-730 processing times are based on completions made at the Texas and Nebraska Service Centers only.,,,,,,,,,,,,
