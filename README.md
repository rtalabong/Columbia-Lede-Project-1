# Visualizing my immigration process

## What I aimed to accomplish
I wanted to accomplish the following:

1.  What is the scale of the United States immigration system and where does my petition fit in it?
2.  Does the speed of immigration processing change depending on the president? By how much?
3.  Within President Joe Biden's term, how much do processing times fluctuate?

## The product, the tool, and the data
| Visualization | Data used | Right-aligned |
| :---         | :---           | :---          |
| 1. US immigration process flow chart   | [My quarter's USCIS data](https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/reports/quarterly_all_forms_fy2024_q2.xlsx)     | Sankeygram, Adobe Illustrator|
| 2. Immigration speed per president     | [Annual USCIS data](https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/historic-pt)|Datawrapper, Adobe Illustrator|
| 3. Immigration speed under President Biden     | [Quarterly USCIS data](https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/immigration-and-citizenship-data)|Datawrapper, Adobe Illustrator|

The data shows that immigration processing time slowed down under President Trump after President Obama's term. It further slowed down under President Biden. Within Biden's term, there are notable fluctuations in processing time for some immigration forms, such as requests for traveling while waiting for one's immigration petition and the application for a waiver to stay unlawfully in the United States.

## What I learned
I got to use both the data analysis and data visualization lessons I have learned in the program. The entire project clarified for me how interconnected each step of the process is and how important it was to exhaust all angles during the data analysis stage of the project. Case in point, I found new angles to the story as I was in the visualization step and it took a lot of my time as I had to return to the pandas wireframe and work with the data again.

## What I wanted to do more
If I had the data, I would have loved to complement the immigration speed with the immigration denial rate of each president.
